Analysis of Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CEmOC) Capacity in Selected LGAs in Nigeria
This project analyzes the capacity of Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CEmOC) facilities across selected Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Nigeria, based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations. According to the WHO, every 500,000 people should have at least four Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC) facilities and one Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CEmOC) facility. This analysis focuses on 102 LGAs across 15 states, evaluating whether these regions meet the CEmOC benchmarks.

## Key Questions Addressed:
 1. Which LGAs did not meet the benchmark of at least 1 CEmOC facility?  
    Answer: All LGAs met this benchmark (0 LGAs fell short).

2.  Which LGAs lacked a 24-hour CEmOC facility while meeting the 1 CEmOC benchmark?  
    Answer: All LGAs met the 24-hour service benchmark (0 LGAs fell short).

3.  If only public-owned CEmOC facilities were counted, how many LGAs would fail to meet the benchmark?  
    Answer: 37 LGAs would not meet the benchmark under this condition.

4.  If only non-profits (religious organizations and NGOs) provided CEmOC facilities, how many LGAs would fail to meet the benchmark?  
    Answer: 64 LGAs would fall short under this scenario.

5.  Which LGAs need more Secondary and Tertiary level CEmOC facilities to meet the benchmark?  
    Answer: Only Nnewi North failed to meet the secondary and tertiary CEmOC facilities benchmark.
